## Out of Space

To what extent will development in technology create new ways for ads to intrude into our lives ?
Are we moving towards a dystopian future where humans lose control over their own thoughts, behaviours and preceptions ?
Furethermore, are we prisoners of our creation of the digitalized and algorithmic world


## Project Outcome

Creating a visual representation of data through patterns and repititions that are built on collected information and research.
While also trying to reflect the idea that all data is connected and how we're living with them.
