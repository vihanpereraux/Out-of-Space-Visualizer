                    My mind is mine to fill or empty and I’d like to keep it that way as much as possible” (Conners, 2015. Para. 2). 
                    Living in the ear of digital revolution and algorithmic cultures may lead to losing sense of what we’re consuming 
                    which can control and manipulate the way we perceive the world, ourselves and surroundings. This aim of this project 
                    is the exploration and awareness of taking ownership of our minds and be aware of what we may consume. Also, provoking 
                    the audience by providing visualized representations of data, trying to reinforce that even though we cannot see or touch 
                    data, it is living among us, can be used against us and can change our lives and the way we think without us realizing it.

                    When thinking of the visual outcome based on the data, these are the main points, one or more than one of the points can be 
                    presented in an art piece or a series of connected visuals. <br>

                    Reflecting the idea that all data is connected somehow and we’re living within in them. <br> 

                    If we were able to see, touch and feel data and algorithms around us, how would it look like? <br>  

                    Exploring data as a form, as something that lives among us, and we live within it as will. <br>

                    Algorithms and data invading our personal lives, perceptions and minds. <br>

                    Data and Algorithms between visibility and invisibility. <br>

                <p>
                    To what extent can data and the algorithmic bias affect our lives? are we moving towards a dystopian future where humans lose 
                    control over their own thoughts, behaviours and perceptions? Furthermore, are we prisoners of our own creation of the digitized 
                    and algorithmic world?

                <p>
                    Our world today is filled with media elements and technologies that can communicate any messages or visuals to us at any time of 
                    the day. Having the choice to be exposed to a specific message or an idea is no longer an option, whether you like it or not you’ll 
                    still be forced into irrelevant messages all the time. For example, according to Rayport, the current strategy of advertisements has 
                    changed in the past few years and instead of advertising the right ads to the targeted consumers, it became all about trying to persuade 
                    the audience through interruption, reptation and brute ubiquity (2013). This new way of conveying messages through forcing it on consumers 
                    keeps increasing day by day, for example, using every social media platform to show ads and sometimes you can’t even skip the unwanted 
                    visuals that is appearing on your screen. This dilemma is connected to the algorithmic bias as they try to influence people’s perceptions 
                    through technology, data and algorithms. It is becoming about influencing people’s subconscious mind and the collective mind of a society 
                    which leads to manipulating people’s behaviours. Vibe states that due to technology leading our world, humankind is now connected more than 
                    ever in the history of our existing. Media became the global collection tool of people’s psyches, beliefs, intuitions, feelings and our 
                    inner values (2021).
